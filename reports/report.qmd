# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

I feel confident in using SQL for data exploration and aggregation, especially when using SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, and basic joins. I needed more practice with subqueries and CTEs, and this assignment definitely helped with that. Writing dynamic percentage tables and conditionally aggregating using CASE was new and very useful.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 19, and 20). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For the more complex tasks, I first wrote out what I thought the final result should look like, then broke the logic into parts (like counts, totals, and percentages). I validated each subquery before combining them. In the future, I’d also sketch the relationships between data as diagrams to visualize joins better.

3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The biggest takeaway was learning how powerful SQL can be for slicing, summarizing, and transforming data, especially in big real-world datasets. This will be super useful for future data analysis tasks, dashboards, or even performance reporting in internships or job roles.
