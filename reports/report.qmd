Reflection  
1. I feel most confident writing SELECT statements and using GROUP BY, but I need more practice with CROSS JOIN and nested subqueries. This assignment gave me a solid foundation.  
2. For complex tasks like Task 18, I broke them down into parts: first understanding the goal, then writing queries in steps. I used CTEs to test logic piece by piece.  
3. My biggest takeaway is how powerful SQL is for data analysis and transformation. These skills will help me analyze real-world data and automate insights efficiently.

README

A quality README is an important part of EVERY project. Using the Quarto include command we’re including a copy of your README in the project report so that a human can evaluate it.

Make sure that you edit the README so that it’s explanatory! Note that you don’t need a readme within the reports folder for this assignment. We’re only focused on the root README.md.

Here is some info on how to write a good README!
