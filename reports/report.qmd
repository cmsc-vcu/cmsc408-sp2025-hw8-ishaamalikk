## Reflection

1. I feel most confident writing `SELECT` statements and using `GROUP BY`, but I need more practice with `CROSS JOIN` and nested subqueries. This assignment gave me a solid foundation.
2. For complex tasks like Task 18, I broke them down into parts: first understanding the goal, then writing queries in steps. I used CTEs to test logic piece by piece.
3. My biggest takeaway is how powerful SQL is for data analysis and transformation. These skills will help me analyze real-world data and automate insights efficiently.

# README

A quality README is an important part of EVERY project. Using the Quarto *include* command we're including a copy of your README in the project report so that a human can evaluate it.

Make sure that you edit the README so that it's explanatory!  Note that you don't need a readme within the *reports* folder for this assignment. We're only
focused on the root *README.md*.

[Here is some info](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) on how to write a good README!
